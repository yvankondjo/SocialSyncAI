**.agent doc structure:**
We try to maintain & update the .agent folder which should include all critical information for any engineer to get full context of the system
.agent
– Tasks: PRD & implementation plan for each feature
– System: Document the current state of the system (project structure, tech stack, integration points, database schema, and core functionalities such as agent architecture, LLM layer, etc.)
– SOP: Best practices of execute certain tasks (e.g. how to add a schema migration, how to add a new page route, etc.)
– README.md: an index of all the documentations we have so people know what & where to look for things
# When asked to initialise documentation
– Please do deep scan of the codebase, both frontend & backend, to grab full context
– Generate the system & architecture documentation, including
   – project architecture (including project goal, structure, tech stack, integration points)
   – database schema
– If there are critical & complex part, you can create specific documentation around certain parts too (optional)
– Then update the README.md, make sure you include an index of all documentation created in .agent, so anyone can just look at README.md to get full understanding of where to look for what information
– Please consolidate docs as much as possible, no overlap between files, e.g. most basic version just need project_architecture.md, and we can expand from there
# When asked to update documentation
– Please read README.md first to get understanding of what already exist
– Update relevant parts in system & architecture design, or SOP for mistakes we made
– In the end, always update the README.md too to include an index of all documentation files
# When creating new doc files
– Please include Related doc section, clearly list out relevant docs to read for full context
